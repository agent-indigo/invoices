# QAP 3

## Semester 3

## Full Stack JavaScript & Database

## Braden Hynes

## Description

### Invoices

A simple invoice manager built on the PERN stack.

### Not suitable for production

## Extra Scripts

- `server`: Starts only the server
- `stack` : Starts both the server and the client.

## Preparations

Before starting the server for the first time, create a new SQL database and leave it empty.
Also copy `environmentTemplate.txt` to `.env` and fill in the values.
The schema will be built or updated automatically when you start the server.
